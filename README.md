# Weather_downloader
## a Simple weather downloader using open data from The Finnish Meteorological Institute.
- I have no clue how this Catalogue service web interface is supposed to be used so WIP.
#### Input entry to GUI and hit "Lataa Säätiedot" and it should print out weather data from nearest weather station. Only works for places in Finland. 

## You can now also download metar data for different airports. 
- You need to get api key from https://www.checkwx.com/ and add it to get_metar function inside weather.py otherwise metar data download will not work.
